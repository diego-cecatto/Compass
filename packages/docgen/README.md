# Compass
Compass is an open-source project designed to automate the generation of documentation for React components. It offers a convenient way to create a Single [Single Repository](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/software-engineering-blog/how-to-choose-between-mono-repo-and-poly-repo) for your components, streamlining your development workflow. While currently supporting TypeScript, Compass's roadmap includes plans to incorporate JavaScript support in the future.
